        This site is powered entirely by static JSON files stored under
        <code>public/data</code>. To add or edit vocabulary, phrases, quiz
        questions or grammar explanations, open those files in your text editor
        and modify them. Each category contains an array of entries with
        properties such as <code>armenian</code>, <code>transliteration</code>,
        <code>english</code> and optional <code>persian</code> fields. Once you
        rebuild and redeploy the site, your changes will appear automatically.

        For a real production application you could replace this page with a
        formâ€‘based interface that writes to a database or content API. Until
        then, editing the JSON files directly is the simplest approach.
